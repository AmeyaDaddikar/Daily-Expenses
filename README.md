# Daily Expenses

## A S.Y. Java Project using the Swing GUI platform


#### Tasks achieved till now
1. Database designed
2. Basic UI design decided and artially implemented
3. Graph UI used

#### Work remaining to be done
1. JDBC is yet to be attached to this project
2. UI to be tweaked to look appealing
3. Graph to be connected with the data got from the database
4. Minor bug-fixes

To get this project, I would suggest to either
1. git pull --reset. Here's the link to the [Stack Overflow page ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1125968/how-do-i-force-git-pull-to-overwrite-local-files)
explaining the same
2. Simply download the master branch in the form of a zip file.
3. Create a new directory, and write the following commands (basically create another git directory for the project)
```
git init
git git remote add origin https://github.com/AmeyaDaddikar/Daily-Expenses.git
git pull origin master
# IF THIS DOES NOT WORK, THEN
git fetch origin master
```

##### Do add the JRE files specified by Raj to your project
